# Determination of best-performing cluster


To identify the best-performing cluster across the six response variables, data in the clusters were tested for significant differences using the Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum Test. A post-hoc analysis to determine the best-performing cluster was carried out using Dunn's Kruskal-Wallis test with Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons at a significance level of 0.05. Clusters were then assigned ranks, and the best-performing cluster was determined based on ranking across response variables.
